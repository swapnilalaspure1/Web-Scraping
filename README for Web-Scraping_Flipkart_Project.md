# Web-Scraping_Flipkart_Project

In this project, we are going to do web scraping on the Flipkart website for mobile phones under 50K.

With the help of BeautifulSoup, requests libraries and requests.get() function.

Step 1: First, we import all the required libraries.

Step 2: Then, we create a url variable that contains the URL of the website.

Step 3: In the third step, we used "For Loop Conditions" to extract all the pages from the website.

Step 4: Then we crate the soup and the master container, which contains all the information about the product, like Price, Name, Ratings, Etc.

Step 5: After all these steps, we append all the extracted information about the product to the empty list. Here we used "For Loop Again".

Step 6: In this last step, we created a data frame.
